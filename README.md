### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Diet Plan Optimization Program is to use a genetic algorithm to optimize a diet plan based on nutritional requirements. This program aims to find the best combination of nutrients that meet specific dietary goals.

#### 1.2 Actors

1. **User**: The individual using the program to optimize their diet plan.
2. **Genetic Algorithm**: The algorithm responsible for optimizing the diet plan.

#### 1.3 Scope

The program takes into account a predefined set of nutrients and their target values. The genetic algorithm is employed to evolve a population of diet plans to find the optimal diet plan that meets the nutrient requirements.

### 2. Use Case: Diet Plan Optimization

#### 2.1 Use Case Description

- **Use Case Name**: Diet Plan Optimization
- **Description**: The User interacts with the Genetic Algorithm to optimize their diet plan.
- **Actors**: User, Genetic Algorithm

#### 2.2 Pre-Conditions

- The program is running.
- Nutrient requirements and target values are specified.

#### 2.3 Post-Conditions

- The program generates an optimized diet plan that meets the nutrient requirements.

### 3. Process Flow

#### 3.1 Initialization

- The program initializes a population of diet plans with random nutrient values.

#### 3.2 Genetic Algorithm

- The Genetic Algorithm (GA) iteratively evolves the population.
  - Selection: The GA selects individuals from the population based on their fitness.
  - Crossover: Pairs of selected individuals undergo crossover to produce offspring.
  - Mutation: Offspring may undergo mutation to introduce genetic diversity.
  - Fitness Evaluation: The fitness of each individual is evaluated based on how well their diet plan meets the nutrient requirements.
  - Replacement: The new generation replaces the old generation based on fitness.

#### 3.3 Termination

- The GA continues to evolve the population for a specified number of generations.

#### 3.4 Result

- After the termination condition is met, the program outputs the best diet plan found by the GA.

### 4. Detailed Process Steps

#### 4.1 Initialization

1. The program defines the following parameters:
   - Nutrient Count: The number of nutrients in the diet plan.
   - Maximum Nutrient Value: The upper limit for each nutrient value.
   - Population Size: The number of diet plans in the population.
   - Mutation Rate: The probability of mutation during the evolution process.
   - Target Nutrient Values: The desired values for each nutrient.

2. The program initializes a population of diet plans:
   - Each diet plan contains randomly generated nutrient values within the specified range.

#### 4.2 Genetic Algorithm

3. The Genetic Algorithm begins the evolution process:
   - Initialize a generation counter.
   - Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population based on how well their diet plan meets the nutrient requirements.

4. Repeat the following steps until the termination condition is met:

   a. Selection:
      - Select individuals from the population for the next generation based on their fitness. Higher fitness individuals have a higher chance of being selected.

   b. Crossover:
      - Pair selected individuals and perform crossover to create offspring diet plans.
      - Offspring inherit genetic material from their parents.

   c. Mutation:
      - Apply mutation to some offspring diet plans with a probability determined by the mutation rate.
      - Mutation introduces small random changes to nutrient values.

   d. Fitness Evaluation:
      - Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the new generation based on how well their diet plan meets the nutrient requirements.

   e. Replacement:
      - Replace the old generation with the new generation based on fitness.
      - Higher fitness individuals from the new generation replace lower fitness individuals from the old generation.

   f. Increment the generation counter.

#### 4.3 Termination

5. Check the termination condition:
   - If the specified number of generations is reached, terminate the evolution process.

#### 4.4 Result

6. Output the best diet plan found by the GA:
   - The diet plan with the highest fitness represents the optimized diet plan.

7. Display the optimized diet plan to the User.

8. End the program.
